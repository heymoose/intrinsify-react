# Intrinsify-React

This is a port of my Python command line tool called [Intrinsify](https://github.com/heymoose/intrinsify-react).  The command line tool is kinda cool to me, and was useful as a learning experiment, but in the end no one is going to study stock information using a command line tool.  Web apps are where it's at.  So the goal is to move that functionality to a simple web app built with React where the user can enter a list of stock tickers, and the app will spit out the intrinsic values of each along with other data in a nice table.
